# CodeCombiner 🚀

CodeCombiner is a versatile Bash script designed to simplify your coding workflow by merging all your .sh, .cpp, and .c files into one comprehensive file. This tool is perfect for developers looking to consolidate scripts for review, archiving, or sharing. 📚


# Features 🌟

File Aggregation: Quickly combines multiple script files into a single file.
Supports Multiple Extensions: Works with .sh, .cpp, and .c files.
Easy to Use: Run the script with a single command and let it handle everything.
Customizable Output: Easily change the output file's name and format to suit your needs.

# How It Works 🔧

The script scans the current directory and all subdirectories for files with the specified extensions and concatenates their contents into a single file, preserving the original file structure and content.

# Prerequisites 📋

Before running CodeCombiner, make sure you have Bash installed on your system (common on most Unix-like systems). No additional software is required.

# Installation 📥

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with CodeCombiner:



### bash
```
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeCombiner.git
cd CodeCombiner
```


# Usage 🚀
To use CodeCombiner, navigate to the directory containing your script files and run:




### bash
```
Copy code
./CodeCombiner.sh
```

The script will automatically find all .sh, .cpp, and .c files and merge their contents into ExportedContent.txt in the current directory.



# Customization 🛠️
You can customize the output file name by editing the output_file variable within the CodeCombiner.sh script:


### bash
```
Copy code
output_file="YourCustomFileName.txt"
```
